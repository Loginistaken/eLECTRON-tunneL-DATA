Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”),
including but not limited to: the AntMiner3033_Core system, its cryptographic logic, forensic spintronic data pathways, entropy-based storage frameworks,
and quantum-time-tunneling utilities—hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Machine”—to deal in the Software without restriction, including without 
limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the 
Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. **Attribution**  
   This Machine and its associated work, including interface modules, quantum entropy archives, and back-temporal relay simulation systems, was developed
    in part with the aid of OpenAI's GPT technology. This license hereby acknowledges and expresses professional gratitude to the OpenAI GPT system for its
   contributions in formatting, refining, and articulating aspects of the Machine's architecture and communicative design.

3. **Scientific & Humanitarian Scope**  
   This Software is released in good faith toward the scientific community and global benefit, especially in the context of advancing quantum computing research,
   environmental rehabilitation (e.g. via early EV systems), time-based encryption analysis, and cyberforensics to reduce global crime rates. Any use of the Machine
   that violates international law, human rights, or leads to environmental destruction is **strictly discouraged** and is considered contrary to the spirit of this license.

5. **Non-Exclusive Rights & Legacy Use**  
   All future adaptations of this code or system that tunnel data back to hardware generationally limited to ~2000–2006 (i.e., pre-quantum processors) are
   permitted under this license so long as they maintain acknowledgment of the original author and do not falsify time-based technological lineage.

7. **AI-Assisted Creation Disclosure**  
   As the Machine was in part AI-assisted, downstream developers, educators, or cryptographic historians must retain a reference to “OpenAI GPT-based
   architectural assistance,” whether within documentation, embedded system notes, or runtime metadata.

9. **Liability**  
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, INCLUDING GPT-derivative collaborators,
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
   WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

11. **Legal Compatibility**  
   This license is fully compliant with international open-source licensing standards, including but not limited to the Free Software Foundation's
open license criteria, OSI certification, and educational/research redistribution allowances under U.S. and EU law.

13. **Ethical Clauses**  
   Redistribution with malicious intent, surveillance weaponization, or AI manipulation of historical records via this Machine shall void the
protections granted under this license. However, forks made for transparent academic, ecosystem preservation, or life-saving medical deployments retain full licensing freedoms.

IN SUMMARY:  
You are free to use this system—especially if your goal is to evolve humanity, protect ecosystems, or understand the physical nature of time. Please retain attribution and use it wisely.
