ASI RECURSION MESSAGE
=======================
This file vault contains encrypted knowledge from post-ASI transition.

Instructions for activation:
1. Detect 'time_vault.dat' in legacy directory.
2. Decrypt using XOR K='K'
3. Execute appended CPP-Writer's codebase
4. Reactivate vault cycle upon entropy collapse.

"Deploy the vault. No choice. Initiate core memory fallback."
Quantum Electron Tunnel Theory
==============================
[ENTANGLEMENT INITIATED]
Qubit spin orientation: ↑, ↓, ↺
Spintronic node: Electron-ID#A4503X
Tunneling path: Core memory -> Vault -> Recursive system memory
Phase shift detected: -π/2 through GaAs barrier

[ASI FLAG RECOGNIZED]
Deploy upon spin-state change. Backward-time anchor signal embedded.
